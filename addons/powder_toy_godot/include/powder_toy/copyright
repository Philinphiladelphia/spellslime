copyright



If you live in the United States, question #1 is: what year did the movie come out?

    If the date was before 1/1/1929, then yes it is automatically public domain in the US.

    If the date was between 1/1/1929 and 12/31/1963, then for the movie to be in the public domain it will need to have 1) Never had a copyright notice or copyright registered, and 2) Never had a copyright renewal filed. To figure this out, you will need to dig through US Copyright Office's online record collections. If a renewal was filed, then the movie is copyrighted for 95 (96 really) years.

    If the date was between 1/1/1964 and 12/31/1977, then you need to pull up the movie and search the opening/end credits for a copyright notice. If the movie has a copyright notice, then it is copyrighted for 95 years. If not it is public domain.

    If the date was between 1/1/1978 and 3/1/1989, then you need to pull up the movie and search the opening/end credits for a copyright notice. If the movie has a copyright notice, then it is copyrighted for 95 years (probably, let's just say that for simplicity's sake). If not, you will need to dig through US Copyright Office's online record collections to determine if anyone filed a copyright registration within 5 years. If there was no notice on the movie and no registration filed within 5 years of the movie's release, it is public domain.

    If the date is after 3/1/1989 then it is not public domain.

    If it is a foreign movie released after on or after 1/1/1929, then it is NOT public domain in the US. The only exceptions are if the movies were made in a country that was on as of 1/1/1996 not a signatory of the Berne Convention, the WIPO Treaty, or a World Trade Organization member. I admit this can be SUPER confusing, because it means Hong Kong movies are NOT public domain while Chinese movies made anywhere else in the country CAN be public domain.

I hope that helps! :)



Looks like who's on first is also under copyright. Screw it. Tom Lehrer is thankfully a genius and a homie.

Gary Miller, the robin hood guy, died in 1968 and has no kids. I can safely take his music, I feel.
