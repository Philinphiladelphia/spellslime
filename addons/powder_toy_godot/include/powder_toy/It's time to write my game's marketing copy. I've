It's time to write my game's marketing copy. I've been thinking about it all morning, my inspiration and love for this game. I really love it, from the bottom of my heat. I wanna make it great, I wanna make it so fun for my players. They're who I really care about. The kid downloading some game they heard about from a youtuber and hopping into a new world that they found all by themselves. The freedom that that brings is profound. That's who my games are for. 

To the kids who dream of new worlds, I say this: with hard work, you can one day build those worlds pulled right out of your head, exactly as you imagine them. It's up to you to learn how to do it!

I want to prove to them that it's possible through my own hard work, just as I'm proving it to myself. That's what life is all about!













I should really crack multiple powder toy instances at the same time when possible. It's a very useful design feature, and it's possible that it wouldn't take that long. I should at least give it a try.

There are a couple Powder Toy things I should get to doing already. I can do all of them from Godot, I think. If not from the c++ godot=cpp middle layer. I really wanna be done touching the powder toy source now.



Why don't I just surround the thing in diamond if I want solids. I don't think solid mode every worked right in the original pwoder toy either.

I should also add functions like draw_line or maybe even draw_ract form powder toy. They're not very hard and very useful.

AI is used to choose between elements names dor spell usage.

Is it worth it to try to pixelate everything? Might be, might not be.




I love that "get off your phone" guy on youtube. Sola shin or something. I want my relationship with life and work to be increasingly more balanced. I wanna build a life filled with the most important things.

I should shoe off the extent of my indie game knowledge.

Teaching requires an appreciation of all different experience levels in the room.

The fact that you showed the general idea of the solution in the beginning (0:30) makes this tutorial S-tier in my book. ‚ù§
