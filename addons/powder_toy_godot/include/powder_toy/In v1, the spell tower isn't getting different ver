In v1, the spell tower isn't getting different versions. The spell tower I have here is the one I'm using for release.

I really love seeing all the open source devs going around saying "hey I used this in my game". It's sch a wonderful moment of human connection.

People can judge absolutely however they want for me using premade assets. Shut the fuck up, I'm running my business. One man can't and shouldn't do everyhtng. Instead, he should use the tools available to him and expand on the ideas he finds in his world! He should try to make art instead of tearing down other's art.

rate or hate! please rate <3

On Pensubic's page: Feel free to use this for commercial projects!
I think this is how to make industry contacts. This guy will be really happy if my game succeeds with his art. The Dark Series is exactly what I need and want. I want a dark tone for half od the game. It should feel mysterious and spooky. That'll give players a good thrill and provide contrast to the overworld.

Let's credit the hell out of Penusbmic for his work and art for this gamme.

Lets go! we're using someone's else's parrallax.

If I'm gonna use this guy's stuff, then Let's show it off to the grestest extent possible and make it look really really good.


I could use two weeks, I get a week. I can live with that.

I can composite michelle's two logos to make one complete logo in this format:


SPELL
SLIME!



My logo will have three animations. Eyes side to side, eyes roll like lottery machine, and move arm to cast spell. I can do a circular screen wipe with a shader at the point of his want to load/unload scenes. That'll add a lot of polish.

So I just gotta run an ollama server and I'm ok. Godot can connect to it using a plugin called fuku.

Let's get talking with the AI. Let's see how it can manifest a spell phrase.

looks like the AI isn't smart enough to do it quick. Gotta write my own format to give to the AI.

Looks like the bullets should be different for every single gun.


Tower with slimes and powder is the key art. Put lots of different kinds of slimes and sizes of slimes. 

I've always preferred starving on my own terms than feasting on someone else's. That's independance.

Hard work is my path to freedom right now. If I work hard, I can earn my freedom. That's so worth it.
