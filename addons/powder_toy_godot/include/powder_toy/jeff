Jeff Bezos Career advice:



At a 2018 gala for global nonprofit FIRST, Bezos shared the best advice he's given his kids when it comes to their careers. "Whatever you do, choose something you can bring passion to," he said.

The Amazon founder added that following your passion is advice he'd give to any young person. "That's going to make it easier for you to make that choice to work hard," he added, per CNBC.

Bezos also admitted that figuring out his own interests took longer than he thought.

"I thought I wanted to be a scientist when I went to Princeton," he explained. "I thought I wanted to be a physicist and halfway through, I figured out I wasn't smart enough to be a physicist."

Through trial and error, however, Bezos was able to discover what he was truly passionate about. "You've gotta figure out what you love," he concluded. "And it's going to bring you great joy."
