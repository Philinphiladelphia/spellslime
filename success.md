I would say keeping motivation up when running into bugs / things I didn’t know how to do was the biggest challenge. It started as a hobby and no social media following so there was also no tangible reason to keep going, but my passion for game development pushed me through!

I communicate with my community all the time. My discord is very active and I always chat to fans on social media. People really do appreciate when I take the time to answer their questions and just talk to them


-No previous experience, just a year or so of messing around with unity -I bought most of the art. Some members from the community I built up offered to help with some of the maps and music -I had 0 followers when I started, and I made sure I interacted with every single comment at the start. I’m still very active in the community now and people seem to enjoy that 

If I’m passionate about something I tend to be a fast learner. I found it all so interesting that I watched and read so many tutorials, even if it was only in the background whilst I was doing something else, at least I could listen and maybe pick up new information. I also made sure to focus on the core mechanic first, which meant I had a playable game fairly early on in development 




I used unity to make the game. We all start somewhere, I had no programming knowledge when I started and used visual scripting tools to help me. Along the way I have picked up coding so you don’t need to be an expert straight away. I also bought a lot of art assets. Some people aren’t a fan of this, but honestly it’s just so cost efficient for a non 3D artist and the game likely would never have happened if pre made assets didn’t exist





Sorry for taking so long to get back to you on this one.

-$700,000 is gross revenue, not including the Kickstarter I ran before release.

-Sales spiked at release, then again at Christmas and when big YouTubers post videos of the game. Ignoring these spikes, average daily sales have steadily increased over the 4 months

-I plan on doing paid advertisements on the official release of the game. For now, it’s in early access but it will release fully later this year. I plan on using the money to fund the rest of the development and for any future games.

-Sales are currently increasing as my social media account grows, but yes after release I plan on continuing to make VR games

-I didn’t expect how hard optimisation would be. To get a physics based destruction game running on Quest is hard, and the game still has a long way to go. Feedback from the community has helped a lot with identifying the features that should take priority

-I have no plans to release any course. I doubt I’ll ever even appear on camera, that’s just not me.
